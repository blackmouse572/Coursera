			<h1 class="headingTitle">Cruise on a Junk Boat through Halong Bay</h1>
			<p>A three-and-a-half-hour drive from the bustle of the city of Hanoi lays a peaceful set of 1,600 islands and islets, Halong Bay. This UNESCO World Heritage site has been the backdrop to many movies, including the Oscar-winning Indochine. Spend a day or a week cruising through the green-topped limestone islands and emerald waters on an ancient-style junk boat.</p>

			<h1 class="headingTitle">Take a Christmas Market Cruise Through Europe</h1>
			<p>There’s nothing that can get you into the holiday spirit quite like the Christmas markets in Europe. Between the lighted cathedrals, festive markets and a simple glass of glühwein, it would be hard not to feel festive!</p>

			<h1 class="headingTitle">Sleep in an Ice Hotel</h1>
			<p>Each year in different chilly locations around the world, hotels are built from natural ice and snow. The IceHotel in the village of Jukkasjärvi, in northern Sweden and The Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel that is nestled in the wilderness of Northern Norway are two of the best. They both are art exhibitions as much as hotels, where the canvases span from floor to ceiling. Spend the night in one of their negative-five-degree rooms, where you will be surrounded by artistically chiseled ice. It’s a bonus that there is also a chance of seeing the Northern Lights from either location!</p>
